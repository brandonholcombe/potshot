# PreToolUse hook: blocks source file edits when active tasks lack review reports.
# Enforces "review before implementation" — the review must exist BEFORE code changes.
# Enforces "independent review" — an agent cannot review its own work.
#
# Logic:
#   1. Only gates production files (src/, k8s/, scripts/, config/)
#   2. If no active tasks exist, allow freely (ad-hoc work)
#   3. If active tasks exist, each must have a review report referencing it
#   4. If any active task is unreviewed, deny the edit
#   5. If the task Author matches the review Reviewer, deny (self-review)
#
# Task documents must contain:    ## Author: <agent-name>
# Review reports must contain:    ## Reviewer: <agent-name>
# The Author and Reviewer must be different for the review to count.
#
# Review reports must reference the task filename (e.g., "my-task.md")
# somewhere in their body to count as a review for that task.
#
# Directory conventions (override via env vars):
#   REVIEW_GATE_TASKS_DIR   — active task documents (default: Agents/TODO/Active)
#   REVIEW_GATE_REVIEWS_DIR — review reports       (default: Agents/Review-reports)
